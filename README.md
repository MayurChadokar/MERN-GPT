This project is a ChatBot application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and integrated with the OpenAI API for natural language processing.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing:** Utilizes the OpenAI API to understand and respond to user input.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration using JWT tokens and encrypted passwords.
- **Message History:** Stores user messages in a database, allowing for message retrieval and deletion.
- **Middleware Chains:** Protects routes and handles errors effectively.
- **Responsive UI:** A clean and intuitive user interface built with React.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MERN-ChatBot.git
    cd MERN-ChatBot
    ```

2. **Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:**
    ```bash
    # For the backend
    cd backend
    npm install

    # For the frontend
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up the environment variables** (see the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below).

4. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **Open your browser:**
    - Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the ChatBot application.

## Usage

1. **Register or log in** to start using the ChatBot.
2. **Interact** with the bot by typing messages into the chat interface.
3. **View your chat history** or delete messages as needed.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following environment variables:

```plaintext
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** Database for storing user messages and authentication data.
- **Express.js:** Backend framework to handle API requests and middleware.
- **React:** Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for running the server-side code.
- **OpenAI API:** Provides natural language processing capabilities.

## Security

- **JWT Tokens:** Secure authentication with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Password Encryption:** User passwords are securely hashed before storing them in the database.
- **HTTP-Only Cookies:** Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks.
